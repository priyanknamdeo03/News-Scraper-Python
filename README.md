Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. 
Beautiful Soup supports the HTML parser included in Python's standard library, however it also supports many external third party python parsers like lxml parser or html5lib parser.
